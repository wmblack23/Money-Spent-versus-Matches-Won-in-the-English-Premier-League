# Money-Spent-versus-Matches-Won-in-the-English-Premier-League

This notebook examines **the role that money plays in teams' success in the English Premier League dating back to the 2000-2001 season.**

- We load season data from 2000-'01 until 2019-'20 via Excel with Pandas.  Data was found on Reddit, The Guardian, and Planet Football (linked in file).

- We use mplcursors and the %matplotlib notebook feature to create interactive sns.regplot graphs where we can click on various points on the graph to learn which team it corresponds to.  By clicking on a point on the graph, we are also able to learn what that teams wage bill, final standings, and points earned were for that season.

- We also plot various bar graphs and examine DataFrames to show how the gulf between what the Top 4 teams and the Bottom 3 teams spend has only gotten larger and larger over the years.

- The data and graphs show very clearly the problem with the English Premier League today: **there is not a level playing field when teams can simply purchase victories due to their incredible financial backings.**

*All code and relevant Excel files are included so please feel free to download and use for yourself!  There is a lot more that can be done with this data to illustrate the wage bill disparities in the EPL.*
