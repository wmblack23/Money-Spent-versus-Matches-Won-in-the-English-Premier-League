# Money-Spent-versus-Matches-Won-in-the-English-Premier-League

This notebook examines **the role that money plays in teams' success in the English Premier League dating back to the 2000-2001 season.**

- We load 14 datasets into our notebook via Pandas and Excel, and find the data for the remaining four seasons by scraping popular websites for EPL final standings and wage bills data.

- We use mplcursors and the %matplotlib notebook feature to create interactive sns.regplot graphs where we can click on various points on the graph to learn which team it corresponds to.  By clicking on a point on the graph, we are also able to learn what that teams wage bill, final standings, and points earned were for that season.

- We also plot various bar graphs and examine DataFrames to show how the gulf between what the Top 4 teams and the Bottom 3 teams spend has only gotten larger and larger over the years.

- The data and graphs show very clearly the problem with the English Premier League today: **there is not a level playing field when teams can simply purchase victories due to their incredible financial backings.**

*All code and relevant Excel files are included so please feel free to download and use for yourself!  There is a lot more that can be done with this data to illustrate the wage bill disparities in the EPL.*
